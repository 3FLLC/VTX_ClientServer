                        PDPZM 0.5
               
PDPZM is a public domain Zmodem program, with full source, and works
on both DOS and OS/2.  In fact, the guts of the Zmodem is isolated
and should be portable to any platform conforming to ISO/IEC 9899:1990.
Currently, I only have zmodem receive implemented, send is just a
demo.  To recompile this (and you WILL need to recompile it to use
it, and if you are using MSDOS you will need to change the IO 
address and IRQ), you will also need PDCOM*.ZIP and PDCRC*.ZIP, both
of which can be obtained from 3:711/934, the author's BBS.  The
author's name is Paul Edwards.  Those two things are a public domain
comms library and a public domain CRC library, respectively.  And
temporarily, you will need to get OZPD*.ZIP in order to compile the
sendzm demo.


The package includes the following:

pdpzm.doc    - This file
pdpgoal.txt  - Goals of the Public Domain Project
reczm.c      - Zmodem implementation of "receive"
reczm.mak    - Makefile for OS/2
reczmd.mak   - Makefile for DOS
sendzm.c     - A *demo* of the makings of "send"
sendzm.mak   - Makefile for OS/2
