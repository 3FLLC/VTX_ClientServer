        What is switchover?     1/6 
                                        
The UK government has committed to     
switching off the analogue TV          
transmitters to allow the digital      
signal to reach more people. This      
process has started and will continue  
on a region by region basis until 2012.
As part of this process, Ceefax will   
disappear from your screens.           
For more information, including the    
regional switchover timetable, visit:
